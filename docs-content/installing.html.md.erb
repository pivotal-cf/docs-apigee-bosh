This topic describes how to install and configure Edge Installer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='overview'></a>Installation Overview
During the installation, the following events occur:

* Ops Manager creates a VM for the Apigee Mirror Repo to host the Apigee `yum` repo, and makes sure that subsequent VMs have access to this repo.
* Ops Manager then creates VMs and installs the Edge components that do not depend on other components, such as Zookeeper. Each Edge component is installed on its own VM.
* Ops Manager then creates the next VM and installs the Edge components that do not depend on any other component except the components that have already been installed.
* The `apigee` user is created on each VM.
* The `apigee-service` utility is installed on each VM in case you have to log in to the VM to troubleshoot issues.

After the installation completes, use the Edge management API to provision an organization, and log in to the Edge UI to start creating API proxies. See [Understanding APIs and API proxies](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies) for more.

##<a id='optional'></a>Install Optional Edge Components

During the install process, you can optionally choose to install additional Edge components, including:

* [Apigee BaaS](http://docs.apigee.com/api-baas)
* [Edge Monitoring Dashboard](http://docs.apigee.com/sites/docs/files/EdgeMonitoringDashboardBeta.pdf)
* [Developer Services portal](http://docs.apigee.com/developer-services/content/what-developer-portal)
* [Monetization](http://docs.apigee.com/monetization/content/basics-monetization)

Installing these components may require you to perform additional onboarding or configuration steps.

Apigee BaaS and Developer Services portal both require an SMTP server. If installed, they use the same SMTP server as configured for Edge.
